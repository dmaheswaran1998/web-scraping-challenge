# web-scraping-challenge

The following line of code on both the scrape_mars.py file and mission_to_mars.ipynb is extremely weird.
results = news_soup.find('div', class_='list_text')

If the notebook / app does not run please copy and re-paste this line of code and then save the file. This sometimes takes a while to work
